# 💩 Poop Launcher

A hilariously unnecessary yet oddly satisfying timing game.  
Sync two trembling poops and fling one across a grassy field while a sarcastic monkey critiques your form.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Tap to sync two rotating poops
- Launch the poop when their center overlaps perfectly
- The poop’s **flight distance depends on how close your tap is to the perfect overlap timing** — when the middle circle is at its largest.
- If your timing is off, a sarcastic monkey will be watching...

⏱️ **Tap at the right moment to maximize your launch distance!**

## 🐒 Monkey Performance

At 150m, 250m, and 300m, mocking monkeys appear holding wine bottles,  
absorbing your poop mid-air and delivering elegant, sarcastic commentary.

> "_This is not mere feces... it’s a postmodern failure._"  
> "_Art, but uninspired._"

## 🎨 Concept

- 💩 Poop as performance art  
- 🌌 A visually infinite, high-class landscape  
- 🐵 Monkeys as social critics  
- 🎻 Classical music turns absurdity into poetry

> _A poop-flinging game with the soul of a gallery installation._
