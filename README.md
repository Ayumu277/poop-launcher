# 💩 Poop Launcher

A hilariously unnecessary yet oddly satisfying timing game.  
Sync two trembling poops and fling one across a grassy field while a sarcastic monkey critiques your form.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Tap to sync two rotating poops
- Launch the poop at just the right moment
- Fly as far as possible
- If you fall short, a wine-bottle-holding monkey will judge your performance... artistically.
- 🎯 Goal: Reach 800m – the monkey may change his tone...

---

## 🐒 Monkey Performance

At 150m, 250m, and 300m, mocking monkeys will appear holding wine bottles,  
absorbing your poop mid-air and delivering elegant, sarcastic commentary.

> "_This is not mere feces... it’s a postmodern failure._"  
> "_Art, but uninspired._"

## 🎨 Concept

- 💩 Poop as performance art
- 🌌 A visually infinite, high-class landscape

- 🎻 Classical music turns absurdity into poetry

> _A poop-flinging game with the soul of a gallery installation._
